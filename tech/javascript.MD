A function's `this` keyword behaves a little differently in JavaScript compared to other languages. It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode.

In the **global execution context (outside of any function)**, `this` refers to the global object whether in `strict mode` or not.

**Inside a function**, the value of this depends on how the function is called.

As an `object method` its `this` is set to the object the method is called on.
